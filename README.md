# Rigorous LLM 

This is my very preliminary project of developing an LLM agent that only includes the truth or facts in the responses when a user's query requires rigorousness. 

I will use LangGraph to implement my "version alpha", but the idea/concept is not limited by LLM agent frameworks (e.g., LangGraph).
